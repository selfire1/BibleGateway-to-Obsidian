Proverbs of Solomon Collected by Hezekiah ###### 1 These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of King Hezekiah of Judah copied: ###### v2 It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, and it is the glory of a king to search out a matter. ###### v3 As the heaven is high and the earth is deep so the hearts of kings are unsearchable. ###### v4 Remove the dross from the silver, and material for the silversmith will emerge; ###### v5 remove the wicked from before the king, and his throne will be established in righteousness. ###### v6 Do not honor yourself before the king, and do not stand in the place of great men; ###### v7 for it is better for him to say to you, "Come up here," than to put you lower before a prince, whom your eyes have seen. ###### v8 Do not go out hastily to litigation, or what will you do afterward when your neighbor puts you to shame? ###### v9 When you argue a case with your neighbor, do not reveal the secret of another person, ###### v10 lest the one who hears it put you to shame and your infamy will never go away. ###### v11 Like apples of gold in settings of silver, so is a word skillfully spoken. ###### v12 Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover to the ear of the one who listens. ###### v13 Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to those who send him, for he refreshes the heart of his masters. ###### v14 Like cloudy skies and wind that produce no rain, so is the one who boasts of a gift not given. ###### v15 Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a soft tongue can break a bone. ###### v16 You have found honey--eat only what is sufficient for you, lest you become stuffed with it and vomit it up. ###### v17 Don't set foot too frequently in your neighbor's house, lest he become weary of you and hate you. ###### v18 Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow, so is the one who testifies against his neighbor as a false witness. ###### v19 Like a bad tooth or a foot out of joint, so is confidence in an unfaithful person at the time of trouble. ###### v20 Like one who takes off a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar poured on soda, so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart. ###### v21 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink, ###### v22 for you will heap coals of fire on his head, and the LORD will reward you. ###### v23 The north wind brings forth rain, and a gossiping tongue brings forth an angry look. ###### v24 It is better to live on a corner of the housetop than in a house in company with a quarrelsome wife. ###### v25 Like cold water to a weary person, so is good news from a distant land. ###### v26 Like a muddied spring and a polluted well, so is a righteous person who gives way before the wicked. ###### v27 It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable for people to seek their own glory. ###### v28 Like a city that is broken down and without a wall, so is a person who cannot control his temper.
