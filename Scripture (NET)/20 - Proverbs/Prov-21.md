###### 1 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD like channels of water; he turns it wherever he wants. ###### v2 All a person's ways seem right in his own opinion, but the LORD evaluates his thoughts. ###### v3 To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. ###### v4 Haughty eyes and a proud heart-- what the wicked cultivate is sin. ###### v5 The plans of the diligent lead only to plenty, but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty. ###### v6 Making a fortune by a lying tongue is like a vapor driven back and forth; they seek death. ###### v7 The violence done by the wicked will drag them away because they have refused to do what is right. ###### v8 The way of the guilty person is devious, but as for the pure, his way is upright. ###### v9 It is better to live on a corner of the housetop than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife. ###### v10 The appetite of the wicked has desired evil; his neighbor is shown no favor in his eyes. ###### v11 When a scorner is punished, the naive becomes wise; when a wise person is instructed, he gains knowledge. ###### v12 The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked; he overthrows the wicked to their ruin. ###### v13 The one who shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too will cry out and will not be answered. ###### v14 A gift given in secret subdues anger, and a bribe given secretly subdues strong wrath. ###### v15 Doing justice brings joy to the righteous and terror to those who do evil. ###### v16 The one who wanders from the way of wisdom will end up in the company of the departed. ###### v17 The one who loves pleasure will be a poor person; whoever loves wine and anointing oil will not be rich. ###### v18 The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the treacherous are taken in the place of the upright. ###### v19 It is better to live in the wilderness than with a quarrelsome and easily provoked woman. ###### v20 There is desirable treasure and olive oil in the dwelling of the wise, but a foolish person devours all he has. ###### v21 The one who pursues righteousness and love finds life, bounty, and honor. ###### v22 A wise man went up against the city of the mighty and brought down the stronghold in which they trust. ###### v23 The one who guards his mouth and his tongue keeps his life from troubles. ###### v24 A proud and arrogant person, whose name is "Scoffer," acts with overbearing pride. ###### v25 What the sluggard desires will kill him, for his hands have refused to work. ###### v26 All day long he has craved greedily, but the righteous person gives and does not hold back. ###### v27 The wicked person's sacrifice is an abomination; how much more when he brings it with evil intent! ###### v28 A lying witness will perish, but the one who reports accurately speaks forever. ###### v29 A wicked person has put on a bold face, but as for the upright, he establishes his ways. ###### v30 There is no wisdom and there is no understanding, and there is no counsel against the LORD. ###### v31 A horse is prepared for the day of battle, but the victory is from the LORD.
