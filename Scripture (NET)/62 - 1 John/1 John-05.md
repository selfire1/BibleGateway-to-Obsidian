Testimony About the Son This is the conquering power that has conquered the world: our faith. ###### v5 Now who is the person who has conquered the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? ###### v6 Jesus Christ is the one who came by water and blood--not by the water only, but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. ###### v7 For there are three that testify, ###### v8 the Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three are in agreement. ###### v9 If we accept the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that he has testified concerning his Son. ###### v10 (The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning his Son.) ###### v11 And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. ###### v12 The one who has the Son has this eternal life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have this eternal life.Assurance of Eternal Life ###### v13 I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. ###### v14 And this is the confidence that we have before him: that whenever we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. ###### v15 And if we know that he hears us in regard to whatever we ask, then we know that we have the requests that we have asked from him. ###### v16 If anyone sees his fellow Christian committing a sin not resulting in death, he should ask, and God will grant life to the person who commits a sin not resulting in death. There is a sin resulting in death. I do not say that he should ask about that. ###### v17 All unrighteousness is sin, but there is sin not resulting in death. ###### v18 We know that everyone fathered by God does not sin, but God protects the one he has fathered, and the evil one cannot touch him. ###### v19 We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. ###### v20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us insight to know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This one is the true God and eternal life. ###### v21 Little children, guard yourselves from idols.
