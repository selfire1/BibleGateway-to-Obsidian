Reason for Judgment: Sins of Nineveh ###### 1 Woe to the city guilty of bloodshed! She is full of lies; she is filled with plunder; she has hoarded her spoil!Portrayal of the Destruction of Nineveh ###### v2 The chariot drivers will crack their whips; the chariot wheels will shake the ground. The chariot horses will gallop; the war chariots will bolt forward! ###### v3 The charioteers will charge ahead; their swords will flash and their spears will glimmer! There will be many people slain; there will be piles of the dead and countless casualties-- so many that people will stumble over the corpses.Taunt against the Harlot City ###### v4 Because you have acted like a wanton prostitute-- a seductive mistress who practices sorcery, who enslaves nations by her harlotry, and entices peoples by her sorcery-- ###### v5 "I am against you," declares the LORD of Heaven's Armies. "I will strip off your clothes! I will show your nakedness to the nations and your shame to the kingdoms. ###### v6 I will pelt you with filth; I will treat you with contempt; I will make you a public spectacle. ###### v7 Everyone who sees you will turn away from you in disgust; they will say, 'Nineveh has been devastated! Who will lament for her?' There will be no one to comfort you!"Nineveh Will Suffer the Same Fate as Thebes ###### v8 You are no more secure than Thebes-- she was located on the banks of the Nile; the waters surrounded her-- her rampart was the sea, the water was her wall. ###### v9 Cush and Egypt had limitless strength; Put and the Libyans were among her allies. ###### v10 Yet she went into captivity as an exile; even her infants were smashed to pieces at the head of every street. They cast lots for her nobility; all her dignitaries were bound with chains. ###### v11 You too will act like drunkards; you will go into hiding; you too will seek refuge from the enemy.The Assyrian Defenses Will Fail ###### v12 All your fortifications will be like fig trees with first-ripe fruit: If they are shaken, their figs will fall into the mouth of the eater. ###### v13 Your warriors will be like women in your midst; the gates of your land will be wide open to your enemies; fire will consume the bars of your gates. ###### v14 Draw yourselves water for a siege! Strengthen your fortifications! Trample the mud and tread the clay! Make mud bricks to strengthen your walls! ###### v15 There the fire will consume you; the sword will cut you down; it will devour you like the young locust would.The Assyrian Defenders Will Flee Multiply yourself like the young locust; multiply yourself like the flying locust! ###### v16 Increase your merchants more than the stars of heaven! They are like the young locust that sheds its skin and flies away. ###### v17 Your courtiers are like locusts, your officials are like a swarm of locusts! They encamp in the walls on a cold day, yet when the sun rises, they fly away, and no one knows where they are.Concluding Dirge ###### v18 Your shepherds are sleeping, O king of Assyria. Your officers are slumbering! Your people are scattered like sheep on the mountains, and there is no one to regather them. ###### v19 Your destruction is like an incurable wound; your demise is like a fatal injury. All who hear what has happened to you will clap their hands for joy, for no one ever escaped your endless cruelty!
