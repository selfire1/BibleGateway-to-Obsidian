Introduction ###### 1 This is an oracle about Nineveh; the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:God Takes Vengeance against His Enemies ###### v2 The LORD is a zealous and avenging God; the LORD is avenging and very angry. The LORD takes vengeance against his foes; he sustains his rage against his enemies. ###### v3 The LORD is slow to anger but great in power; the LORD will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished.The Divine Warrior Destroys His Enemies but Protects His People He marches out in the whirlwind and the raging storm; dark storm clouds billow like dust under his feet. ###### v4 He shouts a battle cry against the sea and makes it dry up; he makes all the rivers run dry. Bashan and Carmel wither; the blossom of Lebanon withers. ###### v5 The mountains tremble before him, the hills convulse; the earth is laid waste before him, the world and all its inhabitants are laid waste. ###### v6 No one can withstand his indignation! No one can resist his fierce anger! His wrath is poured out like volcanic fire, boulders are broken up as he approaches. ###### v7 The LORD is good-- indeed, he is a fortress in time of distress, and he protects those who seek refuge in him. ###### v8 But with an overwhelming flood he will make a complete end of Nineveh; he will drive his enemies into darkness.Denunciation and Destruction of Nineveh ###### v9 Whatever you plot against the LORD, he will completely destroy! Distress will not arise a second time. ###### v10 Surely they will be totally consumed like entangled thorn bushes, like the drink of drunkards, like very dry stubble. ###### v11 From you, O Nineveh, one has marched forth who plots evil against the LORD, a wicked military strategist.Oracle of Deliverance to Judah ###### v12 This is what the LORD says: "Even though they are powerful-- and what is more, even though their army is numerous-- nevertheless, they will be destroyed and trickle away! Although I afflicted you, I will afflict you no more. ###### v13 And now, I will break Assyria's yoke bar from your neck; I will tear apart the shackles that are on you."Oracle of Judgment against the King of Nineveh ###### v14 The LORD has issued a decree against you: "Your dynasty will come to an end. I will destroy the idols and images in the temples of your gods. I will desecrate your grave, because you are accursed!"Proclamation of the Deliverance of Judah ###### v15 (2:1) Look! A herald is running on the mountains! A messenger is proclaiming deliverance: "Celebrate your sacred festivals, O Judah! Fulfill your sacred vows to praise God! For never again will the wicked Assyrians invade you; they have been completely destroyed."
