The kingdom had rest under his rule. ###### v6 He built fortified cities throughout Judah, for the land was at rest and there was no war during those years; the LORD gave him peace. ###### v7 He said to the people of Judah: "Let's build these cities and fortify them with walls, towers, and barred gates. The land remains ours because we have followed the LORD our God; we have followed him, and he has made us secure on all sides." So they built the cities and prospered. ###### v8 Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah, equipped with large shields and spears.

Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on you and have marched on your behalf against this huge army. O LORD, you are our God; don't let men prevail against you!" ###### v12 The LORD struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah.
