The Return to Bethel ###### 1 Then God said to Jacob, "Go up at once to Bethel and live there. Make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau." ###### v2 So Jacob told his household and all who were with him, "Get rid of the foreign gods you have among you. Purify yourselves and change your clothes. ###### v3 Let us go up at once to Bethel. Then I will make an altar there to God, who responded to me in my time of distress and has been with me wherever I went." ###### v4 So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods that were in their possession and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob buried them under the oak near Shechem ###### v5 and they started on their journey. The surrounding cities were afraid of God, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. ###### v6 Jacob and all those who were with him arrived at Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. ###### v7 He built an altar there and named the place El Bethel because there God had revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother. ###### v8 (Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel; thus it was named Oak of Weeping.) ###### v9 God appeared to Jacob again after he returned from Paddan Aram and blessed him. ###### v10 God said to him, "Your name is Jacob, but your name will no longer be called Jacob; Israel will be your name." So God named him Israel. ###### v11 Then God said to him, "I am the Sovereign God. Be fruitful and multiply! A nation--even a company of nations--will descend from you; kings will be among your descendants! ###### v12 The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you. To your descendants I will also give this land." ###### v13 Then God went up from the place where he spoke with him. ###### v14 So Jacob set up a sacred stone pillar in the place where God spoke with him. He poured out a drink offering on it, and then he poured oil on it. ###### v15 Jacob named the place where God spoke with him Bethel. ###### v16 They traveled on from Bethel, and when Ephrath was still some distance away, Rachel went into labor--and her labor was hard. ###### v17 When her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, "Don't be afraid, for you are having another son." ###### v18 With her dying breath, she named him Ben Oni. But his father called him Benjamin instead. ###### v19 So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). ###### v20 Jacob set up a marker over her grave; it is the Marker of Rachel's Grave to this day. ###### v21 Then Israel traveled on and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder. ###### v22 While Israel was living in that land, Reuben went to bed with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard about it. Jacob had twelve sons: ###### v23 The sons of Leah were Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, as well as Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. ###### v24 The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin. ###### v25 The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant, were Dan and Naphtali. ###### v26 The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant, were Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan Aram. ###### v27 So Jacob came back to his father Isaac in Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed. ###### v28 Isaac lived to be 180 years old. ###### v29 Then Isaac breathed his last and joined his ancestors. He died an old man who had lived a full life. His sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
