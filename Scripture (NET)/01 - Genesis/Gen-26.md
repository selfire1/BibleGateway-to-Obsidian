Isaac and Abimelech ###### 1 There was a famine in the land, subsequent to the earlier famine that occurred in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar. ###### v2 The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; settle down in the land that I will point out to you. ###### v3 Stay in this land. Then I will be with you and will bless you, for I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants, and I will fulfill the solemn promise I made to your father Abraham. ###### v4 I will multiply your descendants so they will be as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give them all these lands. All the nations of the earth will pronounce blessings on one another using the name of your descendants. ###### v5 All this will come to pass because Abraham obeyed me and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws." ###### v6 So Isaac settled in Gerar. ###### v7 When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he replied, "She is my sister." He was afraid to say, "She is my wife," for he thought to himself, "The men of this place will kill me to get Rebekah because she is very beautiful." ###### v8 After Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines happened to look out a window and observed Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah. ###### v9 So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, "She is really your wife! Why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac replied, "Because I thought someone might kill me to get her." ###### v10 Then Abimelech exclaimed, "What in the world have you done to us? One of the men nearly took your wife to bed, and you would have brought guilt on us!" ###### v11 So Abimelech commanded all the people, "Whoever touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death." ###### v12 When Isaac planted in that land, he reaped in the same year a hundred times what he had sown, because the LORD blessed him. ###### v13 The man became wealthy. His influence continued to grow until he became very prominent. ###### v14 He had so many sheep and cattle and such a great household of servants that the Philistines became jealous of him. ###### v15 So the Philistines took dirt and filled up all the wells that his father's servants had dug back in the days of his father Abraham. ###### v16 Then Abimelech said to Isaac, "Leave us and go elsewhere, for you have become much more powerful than we are." ###### v17 So Isaac left there and settled in the Gerar Valley. ###### v18 Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug back in the days of his father Abraham, for the Philistines had stopped them up after Abraham died. Isaac gave these wells the same names his father had given them. ###### v19 When Isaac's servants dug in the valley and discovered a well with fresh flowing water there, ###### v20 the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, "The water belongs to us!" So Isaac named the well Esek because they argued with him about it. ###### v21 His servants dug another well, but they quarreled over it too, so Isaac named it Sitnah. ###### v22 Then he moved away from there and dug another well. They did not quarrel over it, so Isaac named it Rehoboth, saying, "For now the LORD has made room for us, and we will prosper in the land." ###### v23 From there Isaac went up to Beer Sheba. ###### v24 The LORD appeared to him that night and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham." ###### v25 Then Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the LORD. He pitched his tent there, and his servants dug a well. ###### v26 Now Abimelech had come to him from Gerar along with Ahuzzah his friend and Phicol the commander of his army. ###### v27 Isaac asked them, "Why have you come to me? You hate me and sent me away from you." ###### v28 They replied, "We could plainly see that the LORD is with you. So we decided there should be a pact between us--between us and you. Allow us to make a treaty with you ###### v29 so that you will not do us any harm, just as we have not harmed you, but have always treated you well before sending you away in peace. Now you are blessed by the LORD." ###### v30 So Isaac held a feast for them and they celebrated. ###### v31 Early in the morning the men made a treaty with each other. Isaac sent them off; they separated on good terms. ###### v32 That day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well they had dug. "We've found water," they reported. ###### v33 So he named it Shibah; that is why the name of the city has been Beer Sheba to this day. ###### v34 When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, as well as Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. ###### v35 They caused Isaac and Rebekah great anxiety.
