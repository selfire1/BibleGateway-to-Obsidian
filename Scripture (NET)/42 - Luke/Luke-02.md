The Census and the Birth of Jesus ###### 1 Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the empire for taxes. ###### v2 This was the first registration, taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria. ###### v3 Everyone went to his own town to be registered. ###### v4 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family line of David. ###### v5 He went to be registered with Mary, who was promised in marriage to him, and who was expecting a child. ###### v6 While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. ###### v7 And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.The Shepherds' Visit ###### v8 Now there were shepherds nearby living out in the field, keeping guard over their flock at night. ###### v9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were absolutely terrified. ###### v10 But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid! Listen carefully, for I proclaim to you good news that brings great joy to all the people: ###### v11 Today your Savior is born in the city of David. He is Christ the Lord. ###### v12 This will be a sign for you: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger." ###### v13 Suddenly a vast, heavenly army appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, ###### v14 "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among people with whom he is pleased!" ###### v15 When the angels left them and went back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, that the Lord has made known to us." ###### v16 So they hurried off and located Mary and Joseph, and found the baby lying in a manger. ###### v17 When they saw him, they related what they had been told about this child, ###### v18 and all who heard it were astonished at what the shepherds said. ###### v19 But Mary treasured up all these words, pondering in her heart what they might mean. ###### v20 So the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen; everything was just as they had been told. ###### v21 At the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was named Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.Jesus' Presentation at the Temple ###### v22 Now when the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary brought Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord ###### v23 (just as it is written in the law of the Lord, "_Every firstborn male_ _will be set apart to the Lord_"), ###### v24 and to offer a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord, **_a pair of doves_** **_or_ _two young pigeons_**.The Prophecy of Simeon ###### v25 Now there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon who was righteous and devout, looking for the restoration of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. ###### v26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ. ###### v27 So Simeon, directed by the Spirit, came into the temple courts, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what was customary according to the law, ###### v28 Simeon took him in his arms and blessed God, saying, ###### v29 "Now, according to your word, Sovereign Lord, permit your servant to depart in peace. ###### v30 For my eyes have seen your salvation ###### v31 that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples: ###### v32 a light, for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel." ###### v33 So the child's father and mother were amazed at what was said about him. ###### v34 Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, "Listen carefully: This child is destined to be the cause of the falling and rising of many in Israel and to be a sign that will be rejected. ###### v35 Indeed, as a result of him the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed--and a sword will pierce your own soul as well!"The Testimony of Anna ###### v36 There was also a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old, having been married to her husband for seven years until his death. ###### v37 She had lived as a widow since then for eighty-four years. She never left the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. ###### v38 At that moment, she came up to them and began to give thanks to God and to speak about the child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem. ###### v39 So when Joseph and Mary had performed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. ###### v40 And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon him.Jesus in the Temple ###### v41 Now Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem every year for the Feast of the Passover. ###### v42 When he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom. ###### v43 But when the feast was over, as they were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, ###### v44 but (because they assumed that he was in their group of travelers) they went a day's journey. Then they began to look for him among their relatives and acquaintances. ###### v45 When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him. ###### v46 After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. ###### v47 And all who heard Jesus were astonished at his understanding and his answers. ###### v48 When his parents saw him, they were overwhelmed. His mother said to him, "Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously." ###### v49 But he replied, "Why were you looking for me? Didn't you know that I must be in my Father's house?" ###### v50 Yet his parents did not understand the remark he made to them. ###### v51 Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. But his mother kept all these things in her heart. ###### v52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and with people.
