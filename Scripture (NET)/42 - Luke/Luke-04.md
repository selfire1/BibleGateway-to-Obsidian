The Temptation of Jesus ###### 1 Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan River and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, ###### v2 where for forty days he endured temptations from the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and when they were completed, he was famished. ###### v3 The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread." ###### v4 Jesus answered him, "It is written, '**_Man_** **_does not live by bread alone_**.'" ###### v5 Then the devil led him up to a high place and showed him in a flash all the kingdoms of the world. ###### v6 And he said to him, "To you I will grant this whole realm--and the glory that goes along with it, for it has been relinquished to me, and I can give it to anyone I wish. ###### v7 So then, if you will worship me, all this will be yours." ###### v8 Jesus answered him, "It is written, '**_You are to worship_** **_the Lord_** **_your_** **_God and serve_** only **_him_**.'" ###### v9 Then the devil brought him to Jerusalem, had him stand on the highest point of the temple, and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, ###### v10 for it is written, '**_He will command his angels concerning you, to protect you_**,' ###### v11 and '**_with their hands they will lift you up, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone_**.'" ###### v12 Jesus answered him, "It is said, '**_You are not to put the Lord your God to the test_**.'" ###### v13 So when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until a more opportune time.The Beginning of Jesus' Ministry in Galilee ###### v14 Then Jesus, in the power of the Spirit, returned to Galilee, and news about him spread throughout the surrounding countryside. ###### v15 He began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by all.Rejection at Nazareth ###### v16 Now Jesus came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read, ###### v17 and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, ###### v18 "**_The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,_** **_because he has anointed_** **_me_ _to proclaim good news_** **_to the poor_**. **_He has sent me_** **_to proclaim release_** **_to the captives_** **_and the regaining of sight_** **_to the blind,_** **_to set free_** **_those who are oppressed,_** ###### v19 **_to proclaim the year_** **_of the Lord's favor_**." ###### v20 Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him. ###### v21 Then he began to tell them, "Today this scripture has been fulfilled even as you heard it being read." ###### v22 All were speaking well of him, and were amazed at the gracious words coming out of his mouth. They said, "Isn't this Joseph's son?" ###### v23 Jesus said to them, "No doubt you will quote to me the proverb, 'Physician, heal yourself!' and say, 'What we have heard that you did in Capernaum, do here in your hometown too.'" ###### v24 And he added, "I tell you the truth, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. ###### v25 But in truth I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's days, when the sky was shut up three and a half years, and there was a great famine over all the land. ###### v26 Yet Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to a woman who was a widow at Zarephath in Sidon. ###### v27 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, yet none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian." ###### v28 When they heard this, all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage. ###### v29 They got up, forced him out of the town, and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff. ###### v30 But he passed through the crowd and went on his way.Ministry in Capernaum ###### v31 So he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he began to teach the people. ###### v32 They were amazed at his teaching, because he spoke with authority. ###### v33 Now in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, ###### v34 "Ha! Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God." ###### v35 But Jesus rebuked him: "Silence! Come out of him!" Then, after the demon threw the man down in their midst, he came out of him without hurting him. ###### v36 They were all amazed and began to say to one another, "What's happening here? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!" ###### v37 So the news about him spread into all areas of the region. ###### v38 After Jesus left the synagogue, he entered Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. ###### v39 So he stood over her, commanded the fever, and it left her. Immediately she got up and began to serve them. ###### v40 As the sun was setting, all those who had any relatives sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus. He placed his hands on every one of them and healed them. ###### v41 Demons also came out of many, crying out, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ. ###### v42 The next morning Jesus departed and went to a deserted place. Yet the crowds were seeking him, and they came to him and tried to keep him from leaving them. ###### v43 But Jesus said to them, "I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns too, for that is what I was sent to do." ###### v44 So he continued to preach in the synagogues of Judea.
