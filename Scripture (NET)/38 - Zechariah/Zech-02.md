Vision Three: The Surveyor ###### 1 (2:5) I looked again, and there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. ###### v2 I asked, "Where are you going?" He replied, "To measure Jerusalem in order to determine its width and its length." ###### v3 At this point the angelic messenger who spoke to me went out, and another messenger came to meet him ###### v4 and said to him, "Hurry, speak to this young man as follows: 'Jerusalem will no longer be enclosed by walls because of the multitude of people and animals there. ###### v5 But I,' the LORD says, 'will be a wall of fire surrounding Jerusalem and the source of glory in her midst.'" ###### v6 "You there! Flee from the northland!" says the LORD, "for like the four winds of heaven I have scattered you," says the LORD. ###### v7 "Escape, Zion, you who live among the Babylonians!" ###### v8 For the LORD of Heaven's Armies says: "For his own glory he has sent me to the nations that plundered you--for anyone who touches you touches the pupil of his eye. ###### v9 Yes, look here, I am about to punish them so that they will be looted by their own slaves." Then you will know that the LORD of Heaven's Armies has sent me. ###### v10 "Sing out and be happy, Zion my daughter! For look, I have come; I will settle in your midst," says the LORD. ###### v11 "Many nations will join themselves to the LORD on the day of salvation, and they will also be my people. Indeed, I will settle in the midst of you all. Then you will know that the LORD of Heaven's Armies has sent me to you. ###### v12 The LORD will take possession of Judah as his portion in the holy land and he will choose Jerusalem once again. ###### v13 Be silent in the LORD's presence, all people everywhere, for he is being moved to action in his holy dwelling place."
