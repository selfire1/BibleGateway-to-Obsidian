Then they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. ###### v2 When David finished offering burnt sacrifices and peace offerings, he pronounced a blessing over the people in the LORD's name. ###### v3 He then handed out to each Israelite man and woman a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake. ###### v4 He appointed some of the Levites to serve before the ark of the LORD, to offer prayers, songs of thanks, and hymns to the LORD God of Israel. ###### v5 Asaph was the leader and Zechariah second-in-command, followed by Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel. They were to play stringed instruments, Asaph was to sound the cymbals, ###### v6 and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel were to blow trumpets regularly before the ark of God's covenant.David Thanks God ###### v7 That day David first gave to Asaph and his colleagues this song of thanks to the LORD. ###### v8 Give thanks to the LORD! Call on his name! Make known his accomplishments among the nations. ###### v9 Sing to him! Make music to him! Tell about all his miraculous deeds. ###### v10 Boast about his holy name. Let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice. ###### v11 Seek the LORD and the strength he gives. Seek his presence continually! ###### v12 Recall the miraculous deeds he performed, his mighty acts and the judgments he decreed, ###### v13 O children of Israel, God's servant, you descendants of Jacob, God's chosen ones! ###### v14 He is the LORD our God; he carries out judgment throughout the earth. ###### v15 Remember continually his covenantal decree, the promise he made to a thousand generations-- ###### v16 the promise he made to Abraham, the promise he made by oath to Isaac! ###### v17 He gave it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as a lasting promise, ###### v18 saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance." ###### v19 When they were few in number, just a very few, and foreign residents within it, ###### v20 they wandered from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another. ###### v21 He let no one oppress them; he disciplined kings for their sake, ###### v22 saying, "Don't touch my anointed ones! Don't harm my prophets!" ###### v23 Sing to the LORD, all the earth! Announce every day how he delivers. ###### v24 Tell the nations about his splendor, tell all the nations about his miraculous deeds. ###### v25 For the LORD is great and certainly worthy of praise, he is more awesome than all gods. ###### v26 For all the gods of the nations are worthless, but the LORD made the heavens. ###### v27 Majestic splendor emanates from him, he is the source of strength and joy. ###### v28 Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the nations, ascribe to the LORD splendor and strength! ###### v29 Ascribe to the LORD the splendor he deserves! Bring an offering and enter his presence! Worship the LORD in holy attire! ###### v30 Tremble before him, all the earth! The world is established, it cannot be moved. ###### v31 Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth be happy! Let the nations say, "The LORD reigns!" ###### v32 Let the sea and everything in it shout! Let the fields and everything in them celebrate! ###### v33 Then let the trees of the forest shout with joy before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth! ###### v34 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good and his loyal love endures. ###### v35 Say this prayer: "Deliver us, O God who delivers us! Gather us! Rescue us from the nations! Then we will give thanks to your holy name, and boast about your praiseworthy deeds." ###### v36 May the LORD God of Israel be praised, in the future and forevermore. Then all the people said, "We agree! Praise the LORD."David Appoints Worship Leaders ###### v37 David left Asaph and his colleagues there before the ark of the LORD's covenant to serve before the ark regularly and fulfill each day's requirements, ###### v38 including Obed-Edom and sixty-eight colleagues.
