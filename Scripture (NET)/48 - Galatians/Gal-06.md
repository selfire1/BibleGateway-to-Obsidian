Support One Another ###### 1 Brothers and sisters, if a person is discovered in some sin, you who are spiritual restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness. Pay close attention to yourselves, so that you are not tempted too. ###### v2 Carry one another's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. ###### v3 For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. ###### v4 Let each one examine his own work. Then he can take pride in himself and not compare himself with someone else. ###### v5 For each one will carry his own load. ###### v6 Now the one who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with the one who teaches it. ###### v7 Do not be deceived. God will not be made a fool. For a person will reap what he sows, ###### v8 because the person who sows to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit. ###### v9 So we must not grow weary in doing good, for in due time we will reap, if we do not give up. ###### v10 So then, whenever we have an opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who belong to the family of faith.Final Instructions and Benediction ###### v11 See what big letters I make as I write to you with my own hand! ###### v12 Those who want to make a good showing in external matters are trying to force you to be circumcised. They do so only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ. ###### v13 For those who are circumcised do not obey the law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised so that they can boast about your flesh. ###### v14 But may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. ###### v15 For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything; the only thing that matters is a new creation! ###### v16 And all who will behave in accordance with this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on the Israel of God. ###### v17 From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body. ###### v18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.
