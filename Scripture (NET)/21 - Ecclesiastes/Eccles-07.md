Life is Brief and Death is Certain ###### 1 A good reputation is better than precious perfume; likewise, the day of one's death is better than the day of one's birth. ###### v2 It is better to go to a funeral than a feast. For death is the destiny of every person, and the living should take this to heart. ###### v3 Sorrow is better than laughter, because sober reflection is good for the heart. ###### v4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of merrymaking.Frivolous Living Versus Wisdom ###### v5 It is better for a person to receive a rebuke from those who are wise than to listen to the song of fools. ###### v6 For like the crackling of quick-burning thorns under a cooking pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This kind of folly also is useless.Human Wisdom Overturned by Adversity ###### v7 Surely oppression can turn a wise person into a fool; likewise, a bribe corrupts the heart. ###### v8 The end of a matter is better than its beginning; likewise, patience is better than pride. ###### v9 Do not let yourself be quickly provoked, for anger resides in the lap of fools. ###### v10 Do not say, "Why were the old days better than these days?" for it is not wise to ask that.Wisdom Can Lengthen One's Life ###### v11 Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing; it benefits those who see the light of day. ###### v12 For wisdom provides protection, just as money provides protection. But the advantage of knowledge is this: Wisdom preserves the life of its owner.Wisdom Acknowledges God's Orchestration of Life ###### v13 Consider the work of God: For who can make straight what he has bent? ###### v14 In times of prosperity be joyful, but in times of adversity consider this: God has made one as well as the other, so that no one can discover what the future holds.Exceptions to the Law of Retribution ###### v15 During the days of my fleeting life I have seen both of these things: Sometimes a righteous person dies prematurely in spite of his righteousness, and sometimes a wicked person lives long in spite of his evil deeds. ###### v16 So do not be excessively righteous or excessively wise; otherwise you might be disappointed. ###### v17 Do not be excessively wicked and do not be a fool; otherwise you might die before your time. ###### v18 It is best to take hold of one warning without letting go of the other warning; for the one who fears God will follow both warnings.Wisdom Needed Because No One is Truly Righteous ###### v19 Wisdom gives a wise person more protection than ten rulers in a city. ###### v20 For there is not one truly righteous person on the earth who continually does good and never sins. ###### v21 Also, do not pay attention to everything that people say; otherwise, you might even hear your servant cursing you. ###### v22 For you know in your own heart that you also have cursed others many times.Human Wisdom is Limited ###### v23 I have examined all this by wisdom; I said, "I am determined to comprehend this"--but it was beyond my grasp. ###### v24 Whatever has happened is beyond human understanding; it is far deeper than anyone can fathom.True Righteousness and Wisdom Are Virtually Nonexistent ###### v25 I tried to understand, examine, and comprehend the role of wisdom in the scheme of things, and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the insanity of folly. ###### v26 I discovered this: More bitter than death is the kind of woman who is like a hunter's snare; her heart is like a hunter's net and her hands are like prison chains. The man who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is captured by her. ###### v27 The Teacher says: I discovered this while trying to discover the scheme of things, item by item. ###### v28 What I have continually sought, I have not found; I have found only one upright man among a thousand, but I have not found one upright woman among all of them. ###### v29 This alone have I discovered: God made humankind upright, but they have sought many evil schemes.
