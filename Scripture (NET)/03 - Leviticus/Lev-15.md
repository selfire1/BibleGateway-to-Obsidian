All the days that his body has a discharge or his body blocks his discharge, this is his uncleanness. ###### v4 "'Any bed the man with a discharge lies on will be unclean, and any furniture he sits on will be unclean. ###### v5 Anyone who touches his bed must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. ###### v6 The one who sits on the furniture the man with a discharge sits on must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. ###### v7 The one who touches the body of the man with a discharge must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. ###### v8 If the man with a discharge spits on a person who is ceremonially clean, that person must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. ###### v9 Any means of riding that the man with a discharge rides on will be unclean. ###### v10 Anyone who touches anything that was under him will be unclean until evening, and the one who carries those items must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. ###### v11 Anyone whom the man with the discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water must wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. ###### v12 A clay vessel which the man with the discharge touches must be broken, and any wooden utensil must be rinsed in water.Purity Regulations for Male Bodily Discharges ###### v13 "'When the man with the discharge becomes clean from his discharge he is to count off for himself seven days for his purification, and he must wash his clothes, bathe in fresh water, and be clean. ###### v14 Then on the eighth day he is to take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and he is to present himself before the LORD at the entrance of the Meeting Tent and give them to the priest, ###### v15 and the priest is to make one of them a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.
