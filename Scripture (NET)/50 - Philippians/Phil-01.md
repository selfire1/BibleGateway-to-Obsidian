Salutation ###### 1 From Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons. ###### v2 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!Prayer for the Church ###### v3 I thank my God every time I remember you. ###### v4 I always pray with joy in my every prayer for all of you ###### v5 because of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now. ###### v6 For I am sure of this very thing, that the one who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus. ###### v7 For it is right for me to think this about all of you, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel all of you became partners in God's grace together with me. ###### v8 For God is my witness that I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. ###### v9 And I pray this, that your love may abound even more and more in knowledge and every kind of insight ###### v10 so that you can decide what is best, and thus be sincere and blameless for the day of Christ, ###### v11 filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.Ministry as a Prisoner ###### v12 I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that my situation has actually turned out to advance the gospel: ###### v13 The whole imperial guard and everyone else knows that I am in prison for the sake of Christ, ###### v14 and most of the brothers and sisters, having confidence in the Lord because of my imprisonment, now more than ever dare to speak the word fearlessly. ###### v15 Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from goodwill. ###### v16 The latter do so from love because they know that I am placed here for the defense of the gospel. ###### v17 The former proclaim Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, because they think they can cause trouble for me in my imprisonment. ###### v18 What is the result? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed, and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, ###### v19 for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. ###### v20 My confident hope is that I will in no way be ashamed but that with complete boldness, even now as always, Christ will be exalted in my body, whether I live or die. ###### v21 For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain. ###### v22 Now if I am to go on living in the body, this will mean productive work for me, yet I don't know which I prefer: ###### v23 I feel torn between the two, because I have a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far, ###### v24 but it is more vital for your sake that I remain in the body. ###### v25 And since I am sure of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for the sake of your progress and joy in the faith, ###### v26 so that what you can be proud of may increase because of me in Christ Jesus, when I come back to you. ###### v27 Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that--whether I come and see you or whether I remain absent--I should hear that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind, by contending side by side for the faith of the gospel, ###### v28 and by not being intimidated in any way by your opponents. This is a sign of their destruction, but of your salvation--a sign which is from God. ###### v29 For it has been granted to you not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for him, ###### v30 since you are encountering the same conflict that you saw me face and now hear that I am facing.
