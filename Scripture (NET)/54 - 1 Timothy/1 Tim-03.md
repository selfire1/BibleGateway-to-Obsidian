Qualifications for Overseers and Deacons ###### 1 This saying is trustworthy: "If someone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a good work." ###### v2 The overseer then must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, an able teacher, ###### v3 not a drunkard, not violent, but gentle, not contentious, free from the love of money. ###### v4 He must manage his own household well and keep his children in control without losing his dignity. ###### v5 But if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for the church of God? ###### v6 He must not be a recent convert or he may become arrogant and fall into the punishment that the devil will exact. ###### v7 And he must be well thought of by those outside the faith, so that he may not fall into disgrace and be caught by the devil's trap. ###### v8 Deacons likewise must be dignified, not two-faced, not given to excessive drinking, not greedy for gain, ###### v9 holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. ###### v10 And these also must be tested first and then let them serve as deacons if they are found blameless. ###### v11 Likewise also their wives must be dignified, not slanderous, temperate, faithful in every respect. ###### v12 Deacons must be husbands of one wife and good managers of their children and their own households. ###### v13 For those who have served well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.Conduct in God's Church ###### v14 I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these instructions to you ###### v15 in case I am delayed, to let you know how people ought to conduct themselves in the household of God, because it is the church of the living God, the support and bulwark of the truth. ###### v16 And we all agree, our religion contains amazing revelation: He was revealed in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among Gentiles, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.
