Conduct Consistent with Sound Teaching ###### 1 But as for you, communicate the behavior that goes with sound teaching. ###### v2 Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in endurance. ###### v3 Older women likewise are to exhibit behavior fitting for those who are holy, not slandering, not slaves to excessive drinking, but teaching what is good. ###### v4 In this way they will train the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children, ###### v5 to be self-controlled, pure, fulfilling their duties at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the message of God may not be discredited. ###### v6 Encourage younger men likewise to be self-controlled, ###### v7 showing yourself to be an example of good works in every way. In your teaching show integrity, dignity, ###### v8 and a sound message that cannot be criticized, so that any opponent will be at a loss, because he has nothing evil to say about us. ###### v9 Slaves are to be subject to their own masters in everything, to do what is wanted and not talk back, ###### v10 not pilfering, but showing all good faith, in order to bring credit to the teaching of God our Savior in everything. ###### v11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people. ###### v12 It trains us to reject godless ways and worldly desires and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, ###### v13 as we wait for the happy fulfillment of our hope in the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. ###### v14 He gave himself for us to set us free from every kind of lawlessness and to purify for himself a people who are truly his, who are eager to do good. ###### v15 So communicate these things with the sort of exhortation or rebuke that carries full authority. Don't let anyone look down on you.
