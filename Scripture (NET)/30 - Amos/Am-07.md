Symbolic Visions of Judgment ###### 1 The Sovereign LORD showed me this: I saw him making locusts just as the crops planted late were beginning to sprout. (The crops planted late sprout after the royal harvest.) ###### v2 When they had completely consumed the earth's vegetation, I said, "Sovereign LORD, forgive Israel! How can Jacob survive? He is too weak!" ###### v3 The LORD decided not to do this. "It will not happen," the LORD said. ###### v4 The Sovereign LORD showed me this: I saw the Sovereign LORD summoning a shower of fire. It consumed the great deep and devoured the fields. ###### v5 I said, "Sovereign LORD, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is too weak!" ###### v6 The LORD decided not to do this. The Sovereign LORD said, "This will not happen either." ###### v7 He showed me this: I saw the Lord standing by a tin wall holding tin in his hand. ###### v8 The LORD said to me, "What do you see, Amos?" I said, "Tin." The Lord then said, "Look, I am about to place tin among my people Israel. I will no longer overlook their sin. ###### v9 Isaac's centers of worship will become desolate; Israel's holy places will be in ruins. I will attack Jeroboam's dynasty with the sword."Amos Confronts a Priest ###### v10 Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent this message to King Jeroboam of Israel: "Amos is conspiring against you in the very heart of the kingdom of Israel! The land cannot endure all his prophecies. ###### v11 As a matter of fact, Amos is saying this: 'Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly be carried into exile away from its land.'" ###### v12 Amaziah then said to Amos, "Leave, you visionary! Run away to the land of Judah. Earn your living and prophesy there! ###### v13 Don't prophesy at Bethel any longer, for a royal temple and palace are here." ###### v14 Amos replied to Amaziah, "I was not a prophet by profession. No, I was a herdsman who also took care of sycamore fig trees. ###### v15 Then the LORD took me from tending flocks and gave me this commission, 'Go! Prophesy to my people Israel.' ###### v16 So now listen to the LORD's message! You say, 'Don't prophesy against Israel! Don't preach against the family of Isaac!' ###### v17 "Therefore this is what the LORD says: 'Your wife will become a prostitute in the streets and your sons and daughters will die violently. Your land will be given to others and you will die in a foreign land. Israel will certainly be carried into exile away from its land.'"
