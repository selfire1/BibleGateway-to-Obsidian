The Lord Will Distinguish Between Sinners and the Godly ###### 1 "I made myself available to those who did not ask for me; I appeared to those who did not look for me. I said, 'Here I am! Here I am!' to a nation that did not invoke my name. ###### v2 I spread out my hands all day long to my rebellious people, who lived in a way that is morally unacceptable, and who did what they desired. ###### v3 These people continually and blatantly offend me as they sacrifice in their sacred orchards and burn incense on brick altars. ###### v4 They sit among the tombs and keep watch all night long. They eat pork, and broth from unclean sacrificial meat is in their pans. ###### v5 They say, 'Keep to yourself! Don't get near me, for I am holier than you!' These people are like smoke in my nostrils, like a fire that keeps burning all day long. ###### v6 Look, I have decreed: I will not keep silent, but will pay them back; I will pay them back exactly what they deserve, ###### v7 for your sins and your ancestors' sins," says the LORD. "Because they burned incense on the mountains and offended me on the hills, I will punish them in full measure." ###### v8 This is what the LORD says: "When juice is discovered in a cluster of grapes, someone says, 'Don't destroy it, for it contains juice.' So I will do for the sake of my servants-- I will not destroy everyone. ###### v9 I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah people to take possession of my mountains. My chosen ones will take possession of the land; my servants will live there. ###### v10 Sharon will become a pasture for sheep, and the Valley of Achor a place where cattle graze; they will belong to my people, who seek me. ###### v11 But as for you who abandon the LORD and forget about worshiping at my holy mountain, who prepare a feast for the god called 'Fortune,' and fill up wine jugs for the god called 'Destiny'-- ###### v12 I predestine you to die by the sword, all of you will kneel down at the slaughtering block, because I called to you, and you did not respond; I spoke and you did not listen. You did evil before me; you chose to do what displeases me." ###### v13 So this is what the Sovereign LORD says: "Look, my servants will eat, but you will be hungry. Look, my servants will drink, but you will be thirsty. Look, my servants will rejoice, but you will be humiliated. ###### v14 Look, my servants will shout for joy as happiness fills their hearts. But you will cry out as sorrow fills your hearts; you will wail because your spirits will be crushed. ###### v15 Your names will live on in the curse formulas of my chosen ones. The Sovereign LORD will kill you, but he will give his servants another name. ###### v16 Whoever pronounces a blessing in the earth will do so in the name of the faithful God; whoever makes an oath in the earth will do so in the name of the faithful God. For past problems will be forgotten; I will no longer think about them. ###### v17 For look, I am ready to create new heavens and a new earth! The former ones will not be remembered; no one will think about them anymore. ###### v18 But be happy and rejoice forevermore over what I am about to create! For look, I am ready to create Jerusalem to be a source of joy, and her people to be a source of happiness. ###### v19 Jerusalem will bring me joy, and my people will bring me happiness. The sound of weeping or cries of sorrow will never be heard in her again. ###### v20 Never again will one of her infants live just a few days or an old man die before his time. Indeed, no one will die before the age of one hundred; anyone who fails to reach the age of one hundred will be considered cursed. ###### v21 They will build houses and live in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. ###### v22 No longer will they build a house only to have another live in it, or plant a vineyard only to have another eat its fruit, for my people will live as long as trees, and my chosen ones will enjoy to the fullest what they have produced. ###### v23 They will not work in vain, or give birth to children that will experience disaster. For the LORD will bless their children and their descendants. ###### v24 Before they even call out, I will respond; while they are still speaking, I will hear. ###### v25 A wolf and a lamb will graze together; a lion, like an ox, will eat straw, and a snake's food will be dirt. They will no longer injure or destroy on my entire royal mountain," says the LORD.
