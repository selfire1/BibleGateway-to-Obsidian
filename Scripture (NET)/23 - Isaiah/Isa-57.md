###### 1 The godly perish, but no one cares. Honest people disappear, when no one minds that the godly disappear because of evil. ###### v2 Those who live uprightly enter a place of peace; they rest on their beds. ###### v3 "But approach, you sons of omen readers, you offspring of adulteresses and prostitutes! ###### v4 At whom are you laughing? At whom are you opening your mouth and sticking out your tongue? You are the children of rebels, the offspring of liars, ###### v5 you who inflame your lusts among the oaks and under every green tree, who slaughter children near the streams under the rocky overhangs. ###### v6 Among the smooth stones of the stream are the idols you love; they, they are the object of your devotion. You pour out liquid offerings to them, you make an offering. Because of these things how can I relent from judgment? ###### v7 On every high, elevated hill you prepare your bed; you go up there to offer sacrifices. ###### v8 Behind the door and doorpost you put your symbols. Indeed, you depart from me and go up and invite them into bed with you. You purchase favors from them; you love their bed, and gaze longingly on their naked bodies. ###### v9 You take olive oil as tribute to your king, along with many perfumes. You send your messengers to a distant place; you go all the way to Sheol. ###### v10 Because of the long distance you must travel, you get tired, but you do not say, 'I give up.' You get renewed energy, so you don't collapse. ###### v11 Whom are you worried about? Whom do you fear, that you would act so deceitfully and not remember me or think about me? Because I have been silent for so long, you are not afraid of me. ###### v12 I will denounce your so-called righteousness and your deeds, but they will not help you. ###### v13 When you cry out for help, let your idols help you! The wind blows them all away, a breeze carries them away. But the one who looks to me for help will inherit the land and will have access to my holy mountain." ###### v14 He says, "Build it! Build it! Clear a way! Remove all the obstacles out of the way of my people!" ###### v15 For this is what the high and exalted one says, the one who rules forever, whose name is holy: "I dwell in an exalted and holy place, but also with the discouraged and humiliated, in order to cheer up the humiliated and to encourage the discouraged. ###### v16 For I will not be hostile forever or perpetually angry, for then man's spirit would grow faint before me, the life-giving breath I created. ###### v17 I was angry because of their sinful greed; I attacked them and angrily rejected them, yet they remained disobedient and stubborn. ###### v18 I have seen their behavior, but I will heal them. I will lead them, and I will provide comfort to them and those who mourn with them. ###### v19 I am the one who gives them reason to celebrate. Complete prosperity is available both to those who are far away and those who are nearby," says the LORD, "and I will heal them. ###### v20 But the wicked are like a surging sea that is unable to be quiet; its waves toss up mud and sand. ###### v21 There will be no prosperity," says my God, "for the wicked."
