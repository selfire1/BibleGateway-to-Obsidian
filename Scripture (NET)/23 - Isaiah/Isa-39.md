Messengers from Babylon Visit Hezekiah ###### 1 At that time Merodach Baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been ill and had recovered. ###### v2 Hezekiah welcomed them and showed them his storehouse with its silver, gold, spices, and high-quality olive oil, as well as his whole armory and everything in his treasuries. Hezekiah showed them everything in his palace and in his whole kingdom. ###### v3 Isaiah the prophet visited King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did these men say? Where do they come from?" Hezekiah replied, "They come from the distant land of Babylon." ###### v4 Isaiah asked, "What have they seen in your palace?" Hezekiah replied, "They have seen everything in my palace. I showed them everything in my treasuries." ###### v5 Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Listen to the message of the LORD of Heaven's Armies: ###### v6 'Look, a time is coming when everything in your palace and the things your ancestors have accumulated to this day will be carried away to Babylon; nothing will be left,' says the LORD. ###### v7 'Some of your very own descendants whom you father will be taken away and will be made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.'" ###### v8 Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The LORD's message that you have announced is appropriate." Then he thought, "For there will be peace and stability during my lifetime."
