**V. The Speeches of Elihu ([32:1-37:24])**Elihu's First Speech ###### 1 So these three men refused to answer Job further, because he was righteous in his own eyes. ###### v2 Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry. He was angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God. ###### v3 With Job's three friends he was also angry, because they could not find an answer, and so declared Job guilty. ###### v4 Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job, because the others were older than he was. ###### v5 But when Elihu saw that the three men had no further reply, he became very angry.Elihu Claims Wisdom ###### v6 So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite spoke up: "I am young, but you are elderly; that is why I was fearful, and afraid to explain to you what I know. ###### v7 I said to myself, 'Age should speak, and length of years should make wisdom known.' ###### v8 But it is a spirit in people, the breath of the Almighty, that makes them understand. ###### v9 It is not the aged who are wise, nor old men who understand what is right. ###### v10 Therefore I say, 'Listen to me. I, even I, will explain what I know.' ###### v11 Look, I waited for you to speak; I listened closely to your wise thoughts, while you were searching for words. ###### v12 Now I was paying you close attention, yet there was no one proving Job wrong, not one of you was answering his statements. ###### v13 So do not say, 'We have found wisdom. God will refute him, not man.' ###### v14 Job has not directed his words to me, and so I will not reply to him with your arguments.Job's Friends Failed to Answer ###### v15 "They are dismayed and cannot answer anymore; they have nothing left to say. ###### v16 And I have waited. But because they do not speak, because they stand there and answer no more, ###### v17 I too will answer my part, I too will explain what I know. ###### v18 For I am full of words, and the spirit within me constrains me. ###### v19 Inside I am like wine that has no outlet, like new wineskins ready to burst! ###### v20 I will speak, so that I may find relief; I will open my lips, so that I may answer. ###### v21 I will not show partiality to any person, nor will I confer a title on anyone. ###### v22 For I do not know how to give honorary titles, if I did, my Creator would quickly do away with me.
