Eliphaz's Third Speech ###### 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered: ###### v2 "Is it to God that a strong man is of benefit? Is it to him that even a wise man is profitable? ###### v3 Is it of any special benefit to the Almighty that you should be righteous, or is it any gain to him that you make your ways blameless? ###### v4 Is it because of your piety that he rebukes you and goes to judgment with you? ###### v5 Is not your wickedness great and is there no end to your iniquity? ###### v6 "For you took pledges from your brothers for no reason, and you stripped the clothing from the naked. ###### v7 You gave the weary no water to drink and from the hungry you withheld food. ###### v8 Although you were a powerful man, owning land, an honored man living on it, ###### v9 you sent widows away empty-handed, and the arms of the orphans you crushed. ###### v10 That is why snares surround you, and why sudden fear terrifies you, ###### v11 why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you. ###### v12 "Is not God on high in heaven? And see the lofty stars, how high they are! ###### v13 But you have said, 'What does God know? Does he judge through such deep darkness? ###### v14 Thick clouds are a veil for him, so he does not see us, as he goes back and forth in the vault of heaven.' ###### v15 Will you keep to the old path that evil men have walked-- ###### v16 men who were carried off before their time, when the flood was poured out on their foundations? ###### v17 They were saying to God, 'Turn away from us,' and, 'What can the Almighty do to us?' ###### v18 But it was he who filled their houses with good things-- yet the counsel of the wicked was far from me. ###### v19 The righteous see their destruction and rejoice; the innocent mock them scornfully, saying, ###### v20 'Surely our enemies are destroyed, and fire consumes their wealth.' ###### v21 "Reconcile yourself with God, and be at peace with him; in this way your prosperity will be good. ###### v22 Accept instruction from his mouth and store up his words in your heart. ###### v23 If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up; if you remove wicked behavior far from your tent, ###### v24 and throw your gold in the dust-- your gold of Ophir among the rocks in the ravines-- ###### v25 then the Almighty himself will be your gold, and the choicest silver for you. ###### v26 Surely then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and will lift up your face toward God. ###### v27 You will pray to him and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows to him. ###### v28 Whatever you decide on a matter, it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways. ###### v29 When people are brought low and you say, 'Lift them up!' then he will save the downcast; ###### v30 he will deliver even someone who is not innocent, who will escape through the cleanness of your hands."
