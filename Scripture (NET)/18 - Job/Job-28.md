**III. Job's Search for Wisdom ([28:1-28])**No Known Road to Wisdom ###### 1 "Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place where gold is refined. ###### v2 Iron is taken from the ground, and rock is poured out as copper. ###### v3 Man puts an end to the darkness; he searches the farthest recesses for the ore in the deepest darkness. ###### v4 Far from where people live he sinks a shaft, in places travelers have long forgotten, far from other people he dangles and sways. ###### v5 The earth, from which food comes, is overturned below as though by fire; ###### v6 a place whose stones are sapphires that contain dust of gold; ###### v7 a hidden path no bird of prey knows-- no falcon's eye has spotted it. ###### v8 Proud beasts have not set foot on it, and no lion has passed along it. ###### v9 On the flinty rock man has set to work with his hand; he has overturned mountains at their bases. ###### v10 He has cut out channels through the rocks; his eyes have spotted every precious thing. ###### v11 He has searched the sources of the rivers and what was hidden he has brought into the light.No Price Can Buy Wisdom ###### v12 "But wisdom--where can it be found? Where is the place of understanding? ###### v13 Mankind does not know its place; it cannot be found in the land of the living. ###### v14 The deep says, 'It is not with me.' And the sea says, 'It is not with me.' ###### v15 Fine gold cannot be given in exchange for it, nor can its price be weighed out in silver. ###### v16 It cannot be measured out for purchase with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or sapphires. ###### v17 Neither gold nor crystal can be compared with it, nor can a vase of gold match its worth. ###### v18 Of coral and jasper no mention will be made; the price of wisdom is more than pearls. ###### v19 The topaz of Cush cannot be compared with it; it cannot be purchased with pure gold.God Alone Has Wisdom ###### v20 "But wisdom--where does it come from? Where is the place of understanding? ###### v21 For it has been hidden from the eyes of every living creature, and from the birds of the sky it has been concealed. ###### v22 Destruction and Death say, 'With our ears we have heard a rumor about where it can be found.' ###### v23 God understands the way to it, and he alone knows its place. ###### v24 For he looks to the ends of the earth and observes everything under the heavens. ###### v25 When he made the force of the wind and measured the waters with a gauge, ###### v26 when he imposed a limit for the rain, and a path for the thunderstorm, ###### v27 then he looked at wisdom and assessed its value; he established it and examined it closely. ###### v28 And he said to mankind, 'The fear of the Lord--that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.'"
