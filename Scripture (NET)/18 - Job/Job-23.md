Job's Reply to Eliphaz ###### 1 Then Job answered: ###### v2 "Even today my complaint is still bitter; his hand is heavy despite my groaning. ###### v3 O that I knew where I might find him, that I could come to his place of residence! ###### v4 I would lay out my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments. ###### v5 I would know with what words he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me. ###### v6 Would he contend with me with great power? No, he would only pay attention to me. ###### v7 There an upright person could present his case before him, and I would be delivered forever from my judge.The Inaccessibility and Power of God ###### v8 "If I go to the east, he is not there, and to the west, yet I do not perceive him. ###### v9 In the north when he is at work, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I see no trace of him. ###### v10 But he knows the pathway that I take; if he tested me, I would come forth like gold. ###### v11 My feet have followed his steps closely; I have kept to his way and have not turned aside. ###### v12 I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my allotted portion. ###### v13 But he is unchangeable, and who can change him? Whatever he has desired, he does. ###### v14 For he fulfills his decree against me, and many such things are his plans. ###### v15 That is why I am terrified in his presence; when I consider, I am afraid because of him. ###### v16 Indeed, God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me. ###### v17 Yet I have not been silent because of the darkness, because of the thick darkness that covered my face.
