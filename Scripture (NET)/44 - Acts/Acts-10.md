Peter Visits Cornelius ###### 1 Now there was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort. ###### v2 He was a devout, God-fearing man, as was all his household; he did many acts of charity for the people and prayed to God regularly. ###### v3 About three o'clock one afternoon he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God who came in and said to him, "Cornelius." ###### v4 Staring at him and becoming greatly afraid, Cornelius replied, "What is it, Lord?" The angel said to him, "Your prayers and your acts of charity have gone up as a memorial before God. ###### v5 Now send men to Joppa and summon a man named Simon, who is called Peter. ###### v6 This man is staying as a guest with a man named Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea." ###### v7 When the angel who had spoken to him departed, Cornelius called two of his personal servants and a devout soldier from among those who served him, ###### v8 and when he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa. ###### v9 About noon the next day, while they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. ###### v10 He became hungry and wanted to eat, but while they were preparing the meal, a trance came over him. ###### v11 He saw heaven opened and an object something like a large sheet descending, being let down to earth by its four corners. ###### v12 In it were all kinds of four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and wild birds. ###### v13 Then a voice said to him, "Get up, Peter; slaughter and eat!" ###### v14 But Peter said, "Certainly not, Lord, for I have never eaten anything defiled and ritually unclean!" ###### v15 The voice spoke to him again, a second time, "What God has made clean, you must not consider ritually unclean!" ###### v16 This happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into heaven. ###### v17 Now while Peter was puzzling over what the vision he had seen could signify, the men sent by Cornelius had learned where Simon's house was and approached the gate. ###### v18 They called out to ask if Simon, known as Peter, was staying there as a guest. ###### v19 While Peter was still thinking seriously about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Look! Three men are looking for you. ###### v20 But get up, go down, and accompany them without hesitation, because I have sent them." ###### v21 So Peter went down to the men and said, "Here I am, the person you're looking for. Why have you come?" ###### v22 They said, "Cornelius the centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear a message from you." ###### v23 So Peter invited them in and entertained them as guests. On the next day he got up and set out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him. ###### v24 The following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting anxiously for them and had called together his relatives and close friends. ###### v25 So when Peter came in, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him. ###### v26 But Peter helped him up, saying, "Stand up. I too am a mere mortal." ###### v27 Peter continued talking with him as he went in, and he found many people gathered together. ###### v28 He said to them, "You know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile, yet God has shown me that I should call no person defiled or ritually unclean. ###### v29 Therefore when you sent for me, I came without any objection. Now may I ask why you sent for me?" ###### v30 Cornelius replied, "Four days ago at this very hour, at three o'clock in the afternoon, I was praying in my house, and suddenly a man in shining clothing stood before me ###### v31 and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your acts of charity have been remembered before God. ###### v32 Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter. This man is staying as a guest in the house of Simon the tanner, by the sea.' ###### v33 Therefore I sent for you at once, and you were kind enough to come. So now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to say to us." ###### v34 Then Peter started speaking: "I now truly understand that God does not show favoritism in dealing with people, ###### v35 but in every nation the person who fears him and does what is right is welcomed before him. ###### v36 You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all)-- ###### v37 you know what happened throughout Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John announced: ###### v38 with respect to Jesus from Nazareth, that God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him. ###### v39 We are witnesses of all the things he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree, ###### v40 but God raised him up on the third day and caused him to be seen, ###### v41 not by all the people, but by us, the witnesses God had already chosen, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. ###### v42 He commanded us to preach to the people and to warn them that he is the one appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead. ###### v43 About him all the prophets testify, that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."The Gentiles Receive the Holy Spirit ###### v44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the message. ###### v45 The circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were greatly astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles, ###### v46 for they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said, ###### v47 "No one can withhold the water for these people to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did, can he?" ###### v48 So he gave orders to have them baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for several days.
