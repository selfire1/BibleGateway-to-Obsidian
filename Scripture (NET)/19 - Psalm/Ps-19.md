Psalm 19 ###### 1 The heavens declare the glory of God; the sky displays his handiwork. ###### v2 Day after day it speaks out; night after night it reveals his greatness. ###### v3 There is no actual speech or word, nor is its voice literally heard. ###### v4 Yet its voice echoes throughout the earth; its words carry to the distant horizon. In the sky he has pitched a tent for the sun. ###### v5 Like a bridegroom it emerges from its chamber; like a strong man it enjoys running its course. ###### v6 It emerges from the distant horizon, and goes from one end of the sky to the other; nothing can escape its heat. ###### v7 The law of the LORD is perfect and preserves one's life. The rules set down by the LORD are reliable and impart wisdom to the inexperienced. ###### v8 The LORD's precepts are fair and make one joyful. The LORD's commands are pure and give insight for life. ###### v9 The commands to fear the LORD are right and endure forever. The judgments given by the LORD are trustworthy and absolutely just. ###### v10 They are of greater value than gold, than even a great amount of pure gold; they bring greater delight than honey, than even the sweetest honey from a honeycomb. ###### v11 Yes, your servant finds moral guidance there; those who obey them receive a rich reward. ###### v12 Who can know all his errors? Please do not punish me for sins I am unaware of. ###### v13 Moreover, keep me from committing flagrant sins; do not allow such sins to control me. Then I will be blameless, and innocent of blatant rebellion. ###### v14 May my words and my thoughts be acceptable in your sight, O LORD, my sheltering rock and my redeemer.
