Psalm 10 ###### 1 Why, LORD, do you stand far off? Why do you pay no attention during times of trouble? ###### v2 The wicked arrogantly chase the oppressed; the oppressed are trapped by the schemes the wicked have dreamed up. ###### v3 Yes, the wicked man boasts because he gets what he wants; the one who robs others curses and rejects the LORD. ###### v4 The wicked man is so arrogant he always thinks, "God won't hold me accountable; he doesn't care." ###### v5 He is secure at all times. He has no regard for your commands; he disdains all his enemies. ###### v6 He says to himself, "I will never be shaken, because I experience no calamity." ###### v7 His mouth is full of curses and deceptive, harmful words; his tongue injures and destroys. ###### v8 He waits in ambush near the villages; in hidden places he kills the innocent. His eyes look for some unfortunate victim. ###### v9 He lies in ambush in a hidden place, like a lion in a thicket. He lies in ambush, waiting to catch the oppressed; he catches the oppressed by pulling in his net. ###### v10 His victims are crushed and beaten down; they are trapped in his sturdy nets. ###### v11 He says to himself, "God overlooks it; he does not pay attention; he never notices." ###### v12 Rise up, LORD! O God, strike him down. Do not forget the oppressed. ###### v13 Why does the wicked man reject God? He says to himself, "You will not hold me accountable." ###### v14 You have taken notice, for you always see one who inflicts pain and suffering. The unfortunate victim entrusts his cause to you; you deliver the fatherless. ###### v15 Break the arm of the wicked and evil man. Hold him accountable for his wicked deeds, which he thought you would not discover. ###### v16 The LORD rules forever! The nations are driven out of his land. ###### v17 LORD, you have heard the request of the oppressed; you make them feel secure because you listen to their prayer. ###### v18 You defend the fatherless and oppressed, so that mere mortals may no longer terrorize them.
