Psalm 40 ###### 1 I relied completely on the LORD, and he turned toward me and heard my cry for help. ###### v2 He lifted me out of the watery pit, out of the slimy mud. He placed my feet on a rock and gave me secure footing. ###### v3 He gave me reason to sing a new song, praising our God. May many see what God has done, so that they might swear allegiance to him and trust in the LORD. ###### v4 How blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD and does not seek help from the proud or from liars. ###### v5 O LORD, my God, you have accomplished many things; you have done amazing things and carried out your purposes for us. No one can thwart you. I want to declare your deeds and talk about them, but they are too numerous to recount. ###### v6 Receiving sacrifices and offerings are not your primary concern. You make that quite clear to me. You do not ask for burnt sacrifices and sin offerings. ###### v7 Then I say, "Look, I come! What is written in the scroll pertains to me. ###### v8 I want to do what pleases you, my God. Your law dominates my thoughts." ###### v9 I have told the great assembly about your justice. Look, I spare no words. O LORD, you know this is true. ###### v10 I have not failed to tell about your justice; I spoke about your reliability and deliverance. I have not neglected to tell the great assembly about your loyal love and faithfulness. ###### v11 O LORD, you do not withhold your compassion from me. May your loyal love and faithfulness continually protect me! ###### v12 For innumerable dangers surround me. My sins overtake me so I am unable to see; they outnumber the hairs of my head so my strength fails me. ###### v13 Please be willing, O LORD, to rescue me! O LORD, hurry and help me! ###### v14 May those who are trying to snatch away my life be totally embarrassed and ashamed. May those who want to harm me be turned back and ashamed. ###### v15 May those who say to me, "Aha! Aha!" be humiliated and disgraced. ###### v16 May all those who seek you be happy and rejoice in you. May those who love to experience your deliverance say continually, "May the LORD be praised!" ###### v17 I am oppressed and needy. May the Lord pay attention to me. You are my helper and my deliverer. O my God, do not delay.
