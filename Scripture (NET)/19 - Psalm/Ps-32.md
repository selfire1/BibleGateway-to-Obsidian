Psalm 32 ###### 1 How blessed is the one whose rebellious acts are forgiven, whose sin is pardoned. ###### v2 How blessed is the one whose wrongdoing the LORD does not punish, in whose spirit there is no deceit. ###### v3 When I refused to confess my sin, my whole body wasted away, while I groaned in pain all day long. ###### v4 For day and night you tormented me; you tried to destroy me in the intense heat of summer. (Selah) ###### v5 Then I confessed my sin; I no longer covered up my wrongdoing. I said, "I will confess my rebellious acts to the LORD." And then you forgave my sins. (Selah) ###### v6 For this reason every one of your faithful followers should pray to you while there is a window of opportunity. Certainly when the surging water rises, it will not reach them. ###### v7 You are my hiding place; you protect me from distress. You surround me with shouts of joy from those celebrating deliverance. (Selah) ###### v8 I will instruct and teach you about how you should live. I will advise you as I look you in the eye. ###### v9 Do not be like an unintelligent horse or mule, which will not obey you unless they are controlled by a bridle and bit. ###### v10 An evil person suffers much pain, but the LORD's faithfulness overwhelms the one who trusts in him. ###### v11 Rejoice in the LORD and be happy, you who are godly! Shout for joy, all you who are morally upright!
