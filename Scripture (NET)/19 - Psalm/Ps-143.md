Psalm 143 ###### 1 O LORD, hear my prayer. Pay attention to my plea for help. Because of your faithfulness and justice, answer me. ###### v2 Do not sit in judgment on your servant, for no one alive is innocent before you. ###### v3 Certainly my enemies chase me. They smash me into the ground. They force me to live in dark regions, like those who have been dead for ages. ###### v4 My strength leaves me; I am absolutely shocked. ###### v5 I recall the old days. I meditate on all you have done; I reflect on your accomplishments. ###### v6 I spread my hands out to you in prayer; my soul thirsts for you in a parched land. (Selah) ###### v7 Answer me quickly, LORD. My strength is fading. Do not reject me, or I will join those descending into the grave. ###### v8 May I hear about your loyal love in the morning, for I trust in you. Show me the way I should go, because I long for you. ###### v9 Rescue me from my enemies, O LORD. I run to you for protection. ###### v10 Teach me to do what pleases you, for you are my God. May your kind presence lead me into a level land. ###### v11 O LORD, for the sake of your reputation, revive me. Because of your justice, rescue me from trouble. ###### v12 As a demonstration of your loyal love, destroy my enemies. Annihilate all who threaten my life, for I am your servant.
