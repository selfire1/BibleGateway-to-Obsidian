Psalm 87 ###### 1 The LORD's city is in the holy hills. ###### v2 The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob. ###### v3 People say wonderful things about you, O city of God. (Selah) ###### v4 I mention Rahab and Babylon to my followers. Here are Philistia and Tyre, along with Ethiopia. It is said of them, "This one was born there." ###### v5 But it is said of Zion's residents, "Each one of these was born in her, and the Most High makes her secure." ###### v6 The LORD writes in the census book of the nations, "This one was born there." (Selah) ###### v7 As for the singers, as well as the pipers-- all of them sing within your walls.
