Psalm 70 ###### 1 O God, please be willing to rescue me. O LORD, hurry and help me. ###### v2 May those who are trying to take my life be embarrassed and ashamed. May those who want to harm me be turned back and ashamed. ###### v3 May those who say, "Aha! Aha!" be driven back and disgraced. ###### v4 May all those who seek you be happy and rejoice in you. May those who love to experience your deliverance say continually, "May God be praised!" ###### v5 I am oppressed and needy. O God, hurry to me. You are my helper and my deliverer. O LORD, do not delay.
