The Lord Establishes a Covenant with David ###### 1 The king settled into his palace, for the LORD gave him relief from all his enemies on all sides. ###### v2 The king said to Nathan the prophet, "Look! I am living in a palace made from cedar, while the ark of God sits in the middle of a tent." ###### v3 Nathan replied to the king, "You should go and do whatever you have in mind, for the LORD is with you." ###### v4 That night the Lord's message came to Nathan, ###### v5 "Go, tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD has said: Do you really intend to build a house for me to live in? ###### v6 I have not lived in a house from the time I brought the Israelites up from Egypt to the present day. Instead, I was traveling with them and living in a tent. ###### v7 Wherever I moved among all the Israelites, I did not say to any of their leaders whom I appointed to care for my people Israel, "Why have you not built me a house made from cedar?"' ###### v8 "So now, say this to my servant David, 'This is what the LORD of Heaven's Armies has said: I took you from the pasture and from your work as a shepherd to make you leader of my people Israel. ###### v9 I was with you wherever you went, and I defeated all your enemies before you. Now I will make you as famous as the great men of the earth. ###### v10 I will establish a place for my people Israel and settle them there; they will live there and not be disturbed anymore. Violent men will not oppress them again, as they did in the beginning ###### v11 and during the time when I appointed judges to lead my people Israel. Instead, I will give you relief from all your enemies. The LORD declares to you that he himself will build a dynastic house for you. ###### v12 When the time comes for you to die, I will raise up your descendant, one of your own sons, to succeed you, and I will establish his kingdom. ###### v13 He will build a house for my name, and I will make his dynasty permanent. ###### v14 I will become his father and he will become my son. When he sins, I will correct him with the rod of men and with wounds inflicted by human beings. ###### v15 But my loyal love will not be removed from him as I removed it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. ###### v16 Your house and your kingdom will stand before me permanently; your dynasty will be permanent.'" ###### v17 Nathan told David all these words that were revealed to him.David Offers a Prayer to God ###### v18 King David went in, sat before the LORD, and said, "Who am I, O Sovereign LORD, and what is my family, that you should have brought me to this point? ###### v19 And you didn't stop there, O LORD God! You have also spoken about the future of your servant's family. Is this your usual way of dealing with men, O Sovereign LORD? ###### v20 What more can David say to you? You have given your servant special recognition, O Sovereign LORD! ###### v21 For the sake of your promise and according to your purpose you have done this great thing in order to reveal it to your servant. ###### v22 Therefore you are great, O Sovereign LORD, for there is none like you. There is no God besides you! What we have heard is true. ###### v23 Who is like your people, Israel, a unique nation on the earth? Their God went to claim a nation for himself and to make a name for himself! You did great and awesome acts for your land, before your people whom you delivered for yourself from the Egyptian empire and its gods. ###### v24 You made Israel your very own people for all time. You, O LORD, became their God. ###### v25 So now, O LORD God, make this promise you have made about your servant and his family a permanent reality. Do as you promised, ###### v26 so you may gain lasting fame, as people say, 'The LORD of Heaven's Armies is God over Israel!' The dynasty of your servant David will be established before you, ###### v27 for you, O LORD of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, have told your servant, 'I will build you a dynastic house.' That is why your servant has had the courage to pray this prayer to you. ###### v28 Now, O Sovereign LORD, you are the true God. May your words prove to be true! You have made this good promise to your servant. ###### v29 Now be willing to bless your servant's dynasty so that it may stand permanently before you, for you, O Sovereign LORD, have spoken. By your blessing may your servant's dynasty be blessed from now on into the future!"
