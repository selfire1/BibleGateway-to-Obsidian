David Sings to the Lord ###### 1 David sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD rescued him from the power of all his enemies, including Saul. ###### v2 He said: "The LORD is my high ridge, my stronghold, my deliverer. ###### v3 My God is my rocky summit where I take shelter, my shield, the horn that saves me, my stronghold, my refuge, my savior. You save me from violence! ###### v4 I called to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I was delivered from my enemies. ###### v5 The waves of death engulfed me; the currents of chaos overwhelmed me. ###### v6 The ropes of Sheol tightened around me; the snares of death trapped me. ###### v7 In my distress I called to the LORD; I called to my God. From his heavenly temple he heard my voice; he listened to my cry for help. ###### v8 The earth heaved and shook; the foundations of the sky trembled. They heaved because he was angry. ###### v9 Smoke ascended from his nose; fire devoured as it came from his mouth; he hurled down fiery coals. ###### v10 He made the sky sink as he descended; a thick cloud was under his feet. ###### v11 He mounted a winged angel and flew; he glided on the wings of the wind. ###### v12 He shrouded himself in darkness, in thick rain clouds. ###### v13 From the brightness in front of him came coals of fire. ###### v14 The LORD thundered from the sky; the Most High shouted loudly. ###### v15 He shot arrows and scattered them, lightning and routed them. ###### v16 The depths of the sea were exposed; the inner regions of the world were uncovered by the LORD's battle cry, by the powerful breath from his nose. ###### v17 He reached down from above and grabbed me; he pulled me from the surging water. ###### v18 He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hate me, for they were too strong for me. ###### v19 They confronted me in my day of calamity, but the LORD helped me. ###### v20 He brought me out into a wide open place; he delivered me because he was pleased with me. ###### v21 The LORD repaid me for my godly deeds; he rewarded my blameless behavior. ###### v22 For I have obeyed the LORD's commands; I have not rebelled against my God. ###### v23 For I am aware of all his regulations, and I do not reject his rules. ###### v24 I was blameless before him; I kept myself from sinning. ###### v25 The LORD rewarded me for my godly deeds; he took notice of my blameless behavior. ###### v26 You prove to be loyal to one who is faithful; you prove to be trustworthy to one who is innocent. ###### v27 You prove to be reliable to one who is blameless, but you prove to be deceptive to one who is perverse. ###### v28 You deliver oppressed people, but you watch the proud and bring them down. ###### v29 Indeed, you are my lamp, LORD. The LORD illumines the darkness around me. ###### v30 Indeed, with your help I can charge against an army; by my God's power I can jump over a wall. ###### v31 The one true God acts in a faithful manner; the LORD's promise is reliable; he is a shield to all who take shelter in him. ###### v32 Indeed, who is God besides the LORD? Who is a protector besides our God? ###### v33 The one true God is my mighty refuge; he removes the obstacles in my way. ###### v34 He gives me the agility of a deer; he enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain. ###### v35 He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend even the strongest bow. ###### v36 You give me your protective shield; your willingness to help enables me to prevail. ###### v37 You widen my path; my feet do not slip. ###### v38 I chase my enemies and destroy them; I do not turn back until I wipe them out. ###### v39 I wipe them out and beat them to death; they cannot get up; they fall at my feet. ###### v40 You give me strength for battle; you make my foes kneel before me. ###### v41 You make my enemies retreat; I destroy those who hate me. ###### v42 They cry out, but there is no one to help them; they cry out to the LORD, but he does not answer them. ###### v43 I grind them as fine as the dust of the ground; I crush them and stomp them like clay in the streets. ###### v44 You rescue me from a hostile army; you preserve me as a leader of nations; people over whom I had no authority are now my subjects. ###### v45 Foreigners are powerless before me; when they hear of my exploits, they submit to me. ###### v46 Foreigners lose their courage; they shake with fear as they leave their strongholds. ###### v47 The LORD is alive! My Protector is praiseworthy! The God who delivers me is exalted as king! ###### v48 The one true God completely vindicates me; he makes nations submit to me. ###### v49 He delivers me from my enemies; you snatch me away from those who attack me; you rescue me from violent men. ###### v50 So I will give you thanks, O LORD, before the nations! I will sing praises to you. ###### v51 He gives his king magnificent victories; he is faithful to his chosen ruler, to David and to his descendants forever!"
