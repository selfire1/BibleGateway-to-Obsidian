Title/Superscription ###### 1 Solomon's Most Excellent Love Song.The Desire for Love ###### v2 Oh, how I wish you would kiss me passionately! For your lovemaking is more delightful than wine. ###### v3 The fragrance of your colognes is delightful; your name is like the finest perfume. No wonder the young women adore you! ###### v4 Draw me after you; let us hurry! May the king bring me into his bedroom chambers! We will rejoice and delight in you; we will praise your love more than wine. How rightly the young women adore you!The Country Maiden and the Daughters of Jerusalem ###### v5 I am dark but lovely, O maidens of Jerusalem, dark like the tents of Qedar, lovely like the tent curtains of Salmah. ###### v6 Do not stare at me because I am dark, for the sun has burned my skin. My brothers were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards. Alas, my own vineyard I could not keep!The Shepherd and the Shepherdess ###### v7 Tell me, O you whom my heart loves, where do you pasture your sheep? Where do you rest your sheep during the midday heat? Tell me lest I wander around beside the flocks of your companions! ###### v8 If you do not know, O most beautiful of women, simply follow the tracks of my flock, and pasture your little lambs beside the tents of the shepherds.The Beautiful Mare and the Fragrant Myrrh ###### v9 O my beloved, you are like a mare among Pharaoh's stallions. ###### v10 Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments; your neck is lovely with strings of jewels. ###### v11 We will make for you gold ornaments studded with silver. ###### v12 While the king was at his banqueting table, my nard gave forth its fragrance. ###### v13 My beloved is like a fragrant pouch of myrrh spending the night between my breasts. ###### v14 My beloved is like a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of En Gedi.Mutual Praise and Admiration ###### v15 Oh, how beautiful you are, my beloved! Oh, how beautiful you are! Your eyes are like doves! ###### v16 Oh, how handsome you are, my lover! Oh, how delightful you are! The lush foliage is our canopied bed; ###### v17 the cedars are the beams of our bedroom chamber; the pines are the rafters of our bedroom.
