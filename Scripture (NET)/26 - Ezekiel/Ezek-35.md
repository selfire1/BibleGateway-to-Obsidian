Prophecy Against Mount Seir ###### 1 The Lord's message came to me: ###### v2 "Son of man, turn toward Mount Seir, and prophesy against it. ###### v3 Say to it, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'Look, I am against you, Mount Seir; I will stretch out my hand against you and turn you into a desolate ruin. ###### v4 I will lay waste your cities, and you will become desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD! ###### v5 "'You have shown unrelenting hostility and poured the people of Israel onto the blades of a sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of their final punishment. ###### v6 Therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will subject you to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you. ###### v7 I will turn Mount Seir into a desolate ruin; I will cut off from it the one who passes through or returns. ###### v8 I will fill its mountains with its dead; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines, those killed by the sword will fall. ###### v9 I will turn you into a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD. ###### v10 "'You said, "These two nations, these two lands will be mine, and we will possess them," (although the LORD was there); ###### v11 therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I will deal with you according to your anger and your envy, by which you acted spitefully against them. I will reveal myself to them when I judge you. ###### v12 Then you will know that I, the LORD, have heard all the insults you spoke against the mountains of Israel, saying, "They are desolate; they have been given to us for food." ###### v13 You exalted yourselves against me with your speech and hurled many insults against me--I have heard them all! ###### v14 This is what the Sovereign LORD says: While the whole earth rejoices, I will turn you into a desolation. ###### v15 As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, so will I deal with you--you will be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom--all of it! Then they will know that I am the LORD.'"
