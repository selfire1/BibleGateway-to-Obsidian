A Prophecy Against the King of Tyre ###### 1 The Lord's message came to me: ###### v2 "Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'Your heart is proud and you said, "I am a god; I sit in the seat of gods, in the heart of the seas"-- yet you are a man and not a god, though you think you are godlike. ###### v3 Look, you are wiser than Daniel; no secret is hidden from you. ###### v4 By your wisdom and understanding you have gained wealth for yourself; you have amassed gold and silver in your treasuries. ###### v5 By your great skill in trade you have increased your wealth, and your heart is proud because of your wealth. ###### v6 "'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you think you are godlike, ###### v7 I am about to bring foreigners against you, the most terrifying of nations. They will draw their swords against the grandeur made by your wisdom, and they will defile your splendor. ###### v8 They will bring you down to the Pit, and you will die violently in the heart of the seas. ###### v9 Will you still say, "I am a god," before the one who kills you-- though you are a man and not a god-- when you are in the power of those who wound you? ###### v10 You will die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners; for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD.'" ###### v11 The Lord's message came to me: ###### v12 "Son of man, sing a lament for the king of Tyre, and say to him, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'You were the sealer of perfection, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. ###### v13 You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering, the ruby, topaz, and emerald, the chrysolite, onyx, and jasper, the sapphire, turquoise, and beryl; your settings and mounts were made of gold. On the day you were created they were prepared. ###### v14 I placed you there with an anointed guardian cherub; you were on the holy mountain of God; you walked about amidst fiery stones. ###### v15 You were blameless in your behavior from the day you were created, until sin was discovered in you. ###### v16 In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned; so I defiled you and banished you from the mountain of God-- the guardian cherub expelled you from the midst of the stones of fire. ###### v17 Your heart was proud because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom on account of your splendor. I threw you down to the ground; I placed you before kings, that they might see you. ###### v18 By the multitude of your iniquities, through the sinfulness of your trade, you desecrated your sanctuaries. So I drew fire out from within you; it consumed you, and I turned you to ashes on the earth before the eyes of all who saw you. ###### v19 All who know you among the peoples are shocked at you; you have become terrified and will be no more.'"A Prophecy Against Sidon ###### v20 The Lord's message came to me: ###### v21 "Son of man, turn toward Sidon and prophesy against it. ###### v22 Say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'Look, I am against you, Sidon, and I will magnify myself in your midst. Then they will know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments on her and reveal my sovereign power in her. ###### v23 I will send a plague into the city and bloodshed into its streets; the slain will fall within it, by the sword that attacks it from every side. Then they will know that I am the LORD. ###### v24 "'No longer will Israel suffer from the sharp briers or painful thorns of all who surround and scorn them. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign LORD. ###### v25 "'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: When I regather the house of Israel from the peoples where they are dispersed, I will reveal my sovereign power over them in the sight of the nations, and they will live in their land that I gave to my servant Jacob. ###### v26 They will live securely in it; they will build houses and plant vineyards. They will live securely when I execute my judgments on all those who scorn them and surround them. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.'"
