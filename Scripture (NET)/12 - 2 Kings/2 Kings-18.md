Hezekiah Becomes King of Judah ###### 1 In the third year of the reign of Israel's King Hoshea son of Elah, Ahaz's son Hezekiah became king over Judah. ###### v2 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah. ###### v3 He did what the LORD approved, just as his ancestor David had done. ###### v4 He eliminated the high places, smashed the sacred pillars to bits, and cut down the Asherah pole. He also demolished the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been offering incense to it; it was called Nehushtan. ###### v5 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; in this regard there was none like him among the kings of Judah either before or after. ###### v6 He was loyal to the LORD and did not abandon him. He obeyed the commandments that the LORD had given to Moses. ###### v7 The LORD was with him; he succeeded in all his endeavors. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to submit to him. ###### v8 He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city. ###### v9 In the fourth year of King Hezekiah's reign (it was the seventh year of the reign of Israel's King Hoshea, son of Elah), King Shalmaneser of Assyria marched up against Samaria and besieged it. ###### v10 After three years he captured it (in the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign); in the ninth year of King Hoshea's reign over Israel, Samaria was captured. ###### v11 The king of Assyria deported the people of Israel to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, along the Habor (the river of Gozan), and in the cities of the Medes. ###### v12 This happened because they did not obey the LORD their God and broke his covenant with them. They did not pay attention to and obey all that Moses, the LORD's servant, had commanded.Sennacherib Invades Judah ###### v13 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, King Sennacherib of Assyria marched up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. ###### v14 King Hezekiah of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria, who was at Lachish, "I have violated our treaty. If you leave, I will do whatever you demand." So the king of Assyria demanded that King Hezekiah of Judah pay 300 talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. ###### v15 Hezekiah gave him all the silver in the LORD's temple and in the treasuries of the royal palace. ###### v16 At that time King Hezekiah of Judah stripped the metal overlays from the doors of the LORD's temple and from the posts that he had plated and gave them to the king of Assyria. ###### v17 The king of Assyria sent his commanding general, the chief eunuch, and the chief adviser from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem, along with a large army. They went up and arrived at Jerusalem. They went and stood at the conduit of the upper pool which is located on the road to the field where they wash and dry cloth. ###### v18 They summoned the king, so Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace supervisor, accompanied by Shebna, the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary, went out to meet them. ###### v19 The chief adviser said to them, "Tell Hezekiah: 'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: "What is your source of confidence? ###### v20 Your claim to have a strategy and military strength is just empty talk. In whom are you trusting that you would dare to rebel against me? ###### v21 Now look, you must be trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed staff. If a man leans for support on it, it punctures his hand and wounds him. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt does to all who trust in him. ###### v22 Perhaps you will tell me, 'We are trusting in the LORD our God.' But Hezekiah is the one who eliminated his high places and altars and then told the people of Judah and Jerusalem, 'You must worship at this altar in Jerusalem.' ###### v23 Now make a deal with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you 2,000 horses, provided you can find enough riders for them. ###### v24 Certainly you will not refuse one of my master's minor officials and trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen. ###### v25 Furthermore it was by the command of the LORD that I marched up against this place to destroy it. The LORD told me, 'March up against this land and destroy it.'"'" ###### v26 Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to the chief adviser, "Speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don't speak with us in the Judahite dialect in the hearing of the people who are on the wall." ###### v27 But the chief adviser said to them, "My master did not send me to speak these words only to your master and to you. His message is also for the men who sit on the wall, for they will eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you." ###### v28 The chief adviser then stood there and called out loudly in the Judahite dialect, "Listen to the message of the great king, the king of Assyria. ###### v29 This is what the king says: 'Don't let Hezekiah mislead you, for he is not able to rescue you from my hand! ###### v30 Don't let Hezekiah talk you into trusting in the LORD when he says, "The LORD will certainly rescue us; this city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria." ###### v31 Don't listen to Hezekiah!' For this is what the king of Assyria says, 'Send me a token of your submission and surrender to me. Then each of you may eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern, ###### v32 until I come and take you to a land just like your own--a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey. Then you will live and not die. Don't listen to Hezekiah, for he is misleading you when he says, "The LORD will rescue us." ###### v33 Have any of the gods of the nations actually rescued his land from the power of the king of Assyria? ###### v34 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Indeed, did any gods rescue Samaria from my power? ###### v35 Who among all the gods of the lands has rescued their lands from my power? So how can the LORD rescue Jerusalem from my power?'" ###### v36 The people were silent and did not respond, for the king had ordered, "Don't respond to him." ###### v37 Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace supervisor, accompanied by Shebna the scribe and Joah son of Asaph, the secretary, went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and reported to him what the chief adviser had said.
