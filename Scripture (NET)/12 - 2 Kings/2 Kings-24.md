Jehoiakim was his subject for three years, but then he rebelled against him. ###### v2 The LORD sent against him Babylonian, Syrian, Moabite, and Ammonite raiding bands; he sent them to destroy Judah, just as in the LORD's message that he had announced through his servants the prophets. ###### v3 Just as the LORD had announced, he rejected Judah because of all the sins that Manasseh had committed. ###### v4 Because he killed innocent people and stained Jerusalem with their blood, the LORD was unwilling to forgive them. ###### v5 The rest of the events of Jehoiakim's reign and all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah. ###### v6 He passed away and his son Jehoiachin replaced him as king. ###### v7 The king of Egypt did not march out from his land again, for the king of Babylon conquered all the territory that the king of Egypt had formerly controlled between the Stream of Egypt and the Euphrates River.Jehoiachin's Reign over Judah ###### v8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
