Healing of a Demoniac ###### 1 So they came to the other side of the lake, to the region of the Gerasenes. ###### v2 Just as Jesus was getting out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came from the tombs and met him. ###### v3 He lived among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain. ###### v4 For his hands and feet had often been bound with chains and shackles, but he had torn the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one was strong enough to subdue him. ###### v5 Each night and every day among the tombs and in the mountains, he would cry out and cut himself with stones. ###### v6 When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before him. ###### v7 Then he cried out with a loud voice, "Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! I implore you by God--do not torment me!" ###### v8 (For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of that man, you unclean spirit!") ###### v9 Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" And he said, "My name is Legion, for we are many." ###### v10 He begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of the region. ###### v11 There on the hillside, a great herd of pigs was feeding. ###### v12 And the demonic spirits begged him, "Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them." ###### v13 Jesus gave them permission. So the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs. Then the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake, and about 2,000 were drowned in the lake. ###### v14 Now the herdsmen ran off and spread the news in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. ###### v15 They came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind--the one who had the "Legion"--and they were afraid. ###### v16 Those who had seen what had happened to the demon-possessed man reported it, and they also told about the pigs. ###### v17 Then they began to beg Jesus to leave their region. ###### v18 As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed asked if he could go with him. ###### v19 But Jesus did not permit him to do so. Instead, he said to him, "Go to your home and to your people and tell them what the Lord has done for you, that he had mercy on you." ###### v20 So he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him, and all were amazed.Restoration and Healing ###### v21 When Jesus had crossed again in a boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and he was by the sea. ###### v22 Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came up, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet. ###### v23 He asked him urgently, "My little daughter is near death. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may be healed and live." ###### v24 Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around him. ###### v25 Now a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years. ###### v26 She had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all that she had. Yet instead of getting better, she grew worse. ###### v27 When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, ###### v28 for she kept saying, "If only I touch his clothes, I will be healed." ###### v29 At once the bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. ###### v30 Jesus knew at once that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and said, "Who touched my clothes?" ###### v31 His disciples said to him, "You see the crowd pressing against you and you say, 'Who touched me?'" ###### v32 But he looked around to see who had done it. ###### v33 Then the woman, with fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. ###### v34 He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your disease." ###### v35 While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue leader's house saying, "Your daughter has died. Why trouble the teacher any longer?" ###### v36 But Jesus, paying no attention to what was said, told the synagogue leader, "Do not be afraid; just believe." ###### v37 He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James. ###### v38 They came to the house of the synagogue leader where he saw noisy confusion and people weeping and wailing loudly. ###### v39 When he entered he said to them, "Why are you distressed and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep!" ###### v40 And they began making fun of him. But he forced them all outside, and he took the child's father and mother and his own companions and went into the room where the child was. ###### v41 Then, gently taking the child by the hand, he said to her, "_Talitha koum_," which means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up." ###### v42 The girl got up at once and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). They were completely astonished at this. ###### v43 He strictly ordered that no one should know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.
