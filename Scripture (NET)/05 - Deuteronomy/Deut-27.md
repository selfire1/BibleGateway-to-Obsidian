The Assembly at Shechem ###### 1 Then Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people: "Pay attention to all the commandments I am giving you today. ###### v2 When you cross the Jordan River to the land the LORD your God is giving you, you must erect great stones and cover them with plaster. ###### v3 Then you must inscribe on them all the words of this law when you cross over, so that you may enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey just as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, said to you. ###### v4 So when you cross the Jordan you must erect on Mount Ebal these stones about which I am commanding you today, and you must cover them with plaster. ###### v5 Then you must build an altar there to the LORD your God, an altar of stones--do not use an iron tool on them. ###### v6 You must build the altar of the LORD your God with whole stones and offer burnt offerings on it to the LORD your God. ###### v7 Also you must offer fellowship offerings and eat them there, rejoicing before the LORD your God. ###### v8 You must inscribe on the stones all the words of this law, making them clear." ###### v9 Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel: "Be quiet and pay attention, Israel. Today you have become the people of the LORD your God. ###### v10 You must obey him and keep his commandments and statutes that I am giving you today." ###### v11 Moreover, Moses commanded the people that day: ###### v12 "The following tribes must stand to bless the people on Mount Gerizim when you cross the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. ###### v13 And these other tribes must stand for the curse on Mount Ebal: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.The Covenant Curses ###### v14 "The Levites will call out to every Israelite with a loud voice: ###### v15 'Cursed is the one who makes a carved or metal image--something abhorrent to the LORD, the work of the craftsman--and sets it up in a secret place.' Then all the people will say, 'Amen!' ###### v16 'Cursed is the one who disrespects his father and mother.'

Then all the people will say, 'Amen!' ###### v23 'Cursed is the one who goes to bed with his mother-in-law.' Then all the people will say, 'Amen!' ###### v24 'Cursed is the one who kills his neighbor in private.' Then all the people will say, 'Amen!' ###### v25 'Cursed is the one who takes a bribe to kill an innocent person.'
